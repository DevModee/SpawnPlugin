## API Access

You can use the `SpawnAPI` class from your own plugin to check or teleport a player to the spawn point.

### Example:

```java
import dev.amargos.api.SpawnAPI;

Player player = ...;

if (SpawnAPI.isSpawnEnabled()) {
    SpawnAPI.teleportToSpawn(player);
}
```

### Available Methods:

```java
public class SpawnAPI {
    public static boolean isSpawnEnabled(); // Check if spawn is set
    public static Location getSpawnLocation(); // Get the current spawn Location
    public static void teleportToSpawn(Player player); // Teleport a player to spawn
}
```

**Note:** Make sure to declare `SpawnPlugin` as a *soft-depend* or *depend* in your plugin.yml when using the API.

## Example Usage

### Setting the spawn location
Run `/setspawn` while standing at the desired location.

### Deleting the spawn location
Use `/delspawn` to remove the spawn.

### Teleporting to spawn
Use `/spawn`. A cooldown may apply depending on config settings.

### Reloading configuration
Make changes in `config.yml` or language files (`lang/messages-*.yml`) and run `/spawnreload` to apply them live.
